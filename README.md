# LLMTime Approach to Forecasting Website Traffic

## Overview
This project implements a dual-approach analysis of website traffic data, combining traditional statistical time series forecasting methods with LLMTime, an innovative LLM-powered analysis technique. The goal is to provide deeper insights into traffic patterns and more accurate predictions for website visitor behavior.

## Dataset
The analysis uses daily website traffic data including:
- Page loads
- Unique visits
- First-time visits
- Returning visits

Data timeframe begins from September 14, 2014, capturing daily metrics across different days of the week.

## Methodology

### Traditional Time Series Analysis
The project employs several statistical methods for traffic analysis:
- Linear Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Decision Tree Regression
- XGBoost
- Facebook Prophet

### LLMTime Implementation
The project innovatively incorporates LLMTime, a cutting-edge approach that leverages Large Language Models for time series analysis. This method offers several advantages:
- Natural language understanding of temporal patterns
- Ability to incorporate contextual factors affecting traffic
- Pattern recognition across multiple time scales
- Adaptive learning from historical trends
